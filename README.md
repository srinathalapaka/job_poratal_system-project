A Job Portal System is an online recruitment platform designed to connect employers and job seekers efficiently. It allows employers to create company profiles, post job vacancies, review applications, and shortlist candidates, while job seekers can register, build their profiles, upload resumes, search for suitable jobs, and apply directly through the portal.

The system provides role-based access for Admin, Employer, and Job Seeker to manage data securely and systematically. It also maintains a centralized database of users, jobs, and applications, reducing manual paperwork and improving communication between recruiters and candidates.

Overall, the Job Portal System simplifies and automates the hiring process, saves time and effort, and helps organizations find suitable candidates quickly while enabling job seekers to discover better career opportunities.
