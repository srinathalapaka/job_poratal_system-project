A Job Portal System is a web application that connects job seekers and employers on one platform. Employers can post jobs and manage applications, while candidates can search and apply for jobs online. It supports role-based access for Admin, Employer, and Job Seeker. The system automates recruitment and makes hiring faster and more efficient.
